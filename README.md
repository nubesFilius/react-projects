# react-projects
Dump bunch of ReactJS projects here for reuse

# You need to run this to create the react dev environment for testing

```bash
npx create-react-app react-complete-guide
```

# Since we have the react project files added to repo, you can simply update the folder by going into the react project and running this cmd. It will fetch the dependencies from json pkg file.

```bash
npm install
```
